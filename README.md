Semester 2 Project
Kinetics + Differential Equations
Yay!

Notes:
- If you are looking to run the code, you can just use the entire.json.
- The entire.csv has a few issues in it, so the json directly created from the parse_csv file won't work in the modeling.py code
- I had to manually fix parts of the entire.json file by running the parsing part of the "modeling.py" over and over again
